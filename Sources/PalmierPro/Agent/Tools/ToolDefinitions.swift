Clip ids are accepted by clip mutation tools; trackId is accepted by manage_tracks.\n\nEvery clip occupies frames: [start, end) — timeline frames, end exclusive, duration = end − start. gaps on a track lists its empty [start, end) spans; no gaps key means contiguous. A video clip's linked audio partner is folded into it as audio: {id, track, …} carrying only what deviates (volumeDb, effects, differing trims); the partner is not repeated on its own track, which instead reports linkedClips (its folded count). Address the audio side by its nested id.\n\nFields equal to their defaults are omitted: mediaType 'video', sourceClipType = mediaType, speed 1, volumeDb 0, opacity 1, edgeRounding 0, edgeSoftness 0, trims/fades 0, identity transform/crop, default textStyle, track muted/hidden false. Text clips never report trims. Keyframe tracks that animate nothing are shown as what they are: identity tracks are dropped, constant ones appear as the static field (e.g. crop: {left: 0.31}). A graded clip carries `color` — its grade in apply_color's own vocabulary, pasteable to other clips via apply_color's color parameter. Other effects appear as effects: [{type, params}], the exact shape apply_effect accepts.\n\nCaption clips (sharing a captionGroupId) come back per track as captionGroups summaries: clipCount, frameRange, shared style, and a textPreview — individual caption clips and their ids are NOT listed. That summary is all you need to restyle (update_text with captionGroupId) or judge coverage; the spoken words live in get_transcript. Only when you must touch individual caption clips (retime one, delete one, fix one word's style), re-read with captionDetail:true — ideally windowed — to get [clipId, startFrame, endFrame, text] rows, capped at 200 per group.

Do not use transform here (or set_keyframes position/scale/crop) to build those layouts.\n\nAll values apply to every clip in clipIds; for per-clip differences, make separate calls. trimStartFrame/trimEndFrame are offsets from the source media, not the timeline. speed 1.0 is normal, <1.0 slows (clip gets longer on the timeline), >1.0 speeds up. volumeDb is −60 through +15 dB; 0 dB keeps source level and −60 dB is mute. opacity is 0.0–1.0. fadeInFrames/fadeOutFrames are clip-relative lengths; 0 clears that fade, and their sum must fit within the resulting clip duration. Fades multiply existing opacity or volume keyframes instead of replacing them: visual/text clips fade opacity, while audio clips fade gain.

            description: "Arrange multiple clips into a common multi-video layout (split screen, picture-in-picture, grid) in one undoable action — the fast path for composing several videos in one frame. Use this instead of hand-setting transforms and screenshot-checking alignment with inspect_timeline.\n\nYou pick a named layout and assign a clip to each of its slots; the tool computes every transform and crop so each clip FILLS its region edge-to-edge WITHOUT stretching — the source is cropped to the slot's shape (cover), like a layout template the videos are dropped into. Pass fit='fit' to letterbox the whole source inside its slot instead (no crop, may leave bars) — use only when the full frame must stay visible (e.g. a screen recording).\n\nThe crop is centered by default. When that chops off something important (a face cropped at the forehead, a subject off to one side), bias which part survives: 'anchor' is a coarse shortcut ('top' keeps the top, etc.), while anchorX/anchorY (0–1) give continuous control for in-between framing — e.g. anchorY 0.35 moves the crop only slightly toward the top, not all the way. To nudge framing after the fact, call apply_layout again with adjusted anchorX/anchorY (clipIds mode re-crops in place).\n\nTwo modes (don't mix across slots):\n• Place new clips: give each slot a 'mediaRef' (media asset from get_media, or a timelineId to nest) plus top-level startFrame (default 0) and endFrame. Creates one stacked video track per slot at that time range; for PIP the inset is placed on top automatically. Video and nested-timeline clips bring their linked audio.\n• Re-layout existing clips: give each slot 'clipIds' — one or more existing clips (video, image, or nested timeline / mediaType 'sequence'), all framed into that slot (handy when a track holds several sequential takes). Only transforms/crop change — timing and tracks are untouched (so existing track order decides stacking).\n\nEvery slot of the chosen layout must be filled. Layouts and their slot names:\n  • full — main\n  • side_by_side — left, right\n  • top_bottom — top, bottom\n  • pip_bottom_right / pip_bottom_left / pip_top_right / pip_top_left — main, inset\n  • grid_2x2 / grid_3x3 / grid_4x4 — equal cells named rNcN, counting from the TOP-LEFT: row 1 is the top row, column 1 is the left column. So r1c1 is top-left, a 3x3's middle is r2c2, and a 3x3's bottom-right is r3c3\n  • main_sidebar — main (70%), sidebar (30%)\n  • three_up — left, center, right (three vertical columns)\n  • three_stack — top, middle, bottom (three horizontal rows)",
